Readme file on AirBnB the console
HolbertonBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. The front end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

HolbertonBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to deploy in the coming month:

Complete integration of a RESTful API
Full configuration of the website with domain name
Serving dynamic content using JavaScript
